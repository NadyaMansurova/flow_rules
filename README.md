This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). And contains some tests.

For fast start I added some rules as initial state. You can click on the rule and see body, id, etc.

For correct JSON-string as user-object I added JSON-parse, if user add simply object, I used eval. If it's string, that can't be parsed as object, application show "Incorrect object" id Results-field.

Install: npm install
Use: npm start
Test: npm test
